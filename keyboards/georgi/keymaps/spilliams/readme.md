# Georgi QWERTY/Steno firmware

This is spilliams' keymap for Georgi. It's based off "minimal", but spilliams
was having trouble getting the keyboard to work in steno mode with plover on a
mac, so here we are.

This iteration of my keymap adds a layer to the minimal map. The new layer
represents all the keys that Plover uses to turn a keyboard into a steno
machine.
