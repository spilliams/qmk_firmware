# Georgi QWERTY/Steno firmware

This is spilliams' keymap for Georgi. It's based off "minimal", but spilliams
was having trouble getting the keyboard to work in steno mode with plover on a
mac, so here we are.

This iteration of my keymap changes how the qwerty layer is processed, so that
it represents all the keys that Plover uses to turn a keyboard into a steno
machine.

In steno mode, the keymap emulates a TX Bolt machine.
