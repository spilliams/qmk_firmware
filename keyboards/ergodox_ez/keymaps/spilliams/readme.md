# Ergodox EZ keymap

This is spilliams' keymap for Ergodox EZ Glow.

It combines ergodox-ez/steno, ergodox/default_glow, and georgi/spilliams.

## TODO

- firmware reset (`RESET`) doesn't work with make, but does work with Wally
- Glow LEDs are using the default pattern, not layer colors
- layer LEDs happen out of order?  
    Base (0) = none  
    Game (1) = blue (3)
    Apple (2) = green (2)
    Symbol (3) = blue (3)
    Extra (4) = red-green (1-2)
- no steno still
- `VERSION` output is meaningless to me
